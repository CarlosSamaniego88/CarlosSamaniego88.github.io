        <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>Hi! I'm Carlos Samaniego, a senior at Wake Forest University majoring in Computer Science. I was born 
                in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, but I currently live in Boca Raton, FL!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am actively searching for internships and jobs to enhance my knowledge of programming.
                I am very interested in learning more about Cyber Security, Security Engineering, Vulnerability Management,
                Penetration Testing, as well as Software Engineering.
